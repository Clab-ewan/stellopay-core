## Quick Start

```rust

let contract = PayrollContract::new(&env);
contract.initialize(&env, &owner_address);

// Create payroll for an employee
let payroll = contract.create_or_update_escrow(
    &env,
    &employer_address,
    &employee_address,
    &token_address,
    &amount,
    &interval,
    &recurrence_frequency,
)?;

// Deposit tokens for salary payments
contract.deposit_tokens(&env, &employer_address, &token_address, &amount)?;

// Disburse salary
contract.disburse_salary(&env, &employer_address, &employee_address)?;
```
